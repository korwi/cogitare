it ended a way between nearby countries. Since astronomers can theorize the

he did not look as nice as he is commonly presented. He was famously very ugly,
with a fat nose and bulging eyes. He would wear the same clothes for days in a
row. He was looked down on for this, significantly, as Athenian society valued
male beauty highly. Despite natural disadvantages, Socrates became arguably one
of the most famous and influential philosophers of all time. He never wrote
anything himself, and it is often difficult to separate his ideas and personality
from those of his students, particularly Plato, from whom we get much of our
information about Socrates.</span></p>

anyone that would listen. He was known for spending time with the young rich
men of Athens. His students would relish his dethroning of the local
intellectuals. The Elenchus, or the Socratic Method involved Socrates
questioning dogmatic intellectuals and demonstrating that they held
contradictory beliefs. This dialectic reversal of asking questions and using
someone else’s claims against them became a staple of education and philosophy.

the wisest man in Athens. This shocked Socrates, because he famously claimed
“All I know is that I know nothing”. This led him to question the claims and
beliefs of others to see if anyone really did know more than he did. He
concluded that perhaps what made the oracle think him wise was that he admitted
his own ignorance, while others dogmatically asserted what they did not know.</span></p>

corrupting the youth and doubting the Gods of the city. INstead of pleading
out, he argued vehemently in his own defense. Read Plato’s “Apology” if you are
curious. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to death. Though he might
have escaped or been given a stay of execution, he argued with his friends that
he must follow the laws of Athens. He willingly drank hemlock and died. Though
he never wrote anything, was quite ugly, and was detested by enough of Athenian
society that he was put to death, Socrates is still a hero for many
philosophers and held up as an example of what philosophy can do. He stood up
for the right of people to question authority and doubt those in power.</span></p>

us a way to live, Plato told us what to think. Plato was the son of one of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"DM Serif Display"'>Plato had many revolutionary ideas. One of the
most important and iconic was his theory of the forms. According to Plato, all
individual particular concrete objects are imperfect copies of the perfect
forms. We see imperfect trees which are simply shadows of the form of a tree.
Plato explains this idea with his famous Allegory of the Cave. Simply, Plato
asks us to imagine prisoners chained in a cave where they can only see the
shadows of objects that pass in front of a fire and hear echoes of voices off
the cave wall. They think that the shadows are the real things, and that the
sounds come from them. Only by moving out of this cave can we come into contact
with the true perfect reality, the world of pure reason and the forms.</span></p>

everyone uses the skills that they have for the benefit of the society. It was
ruled by Philosopher Kings, according to Plato, democracy put too much faith in
the common man to rule. At its best, The Republic represents a utopian society
ruled by reason. At its worst it envisions a totalitarian state with little
regard for personal freedom or choice.</span></p>

of his most famous student Aristotle, but he had a profound influence on the

many Muslim scholars called him “The First Teacher”. Unlike Plato and Socrates,

studies. Though many of his ideas about science were wrong, his rigorous

disciplines from theatre to law and his works are still read by everyone from
playwrights to lawyers. However, there are some common themes. Aristotle
rejected Plato’s forms, in favor of a teleological explanation of the world.
Appropriately, as his name means “the best purpose” in Greek, Aristotle’s
philosophy focused on telos or purpose of all things. We were not shadows of
perfect forms, but beings each with our own purpose in life. Everything,
according to Aristotle, could be described in terms of its goal or purpose. All
things had a purpose, and their natural state was to strive to achieve that
purpose.</span></p>

virtuous? In opposition to other, more modern ethical theories Aristotle talks
less about what particular actions are good, but instead how to be a good
person. The virtues that Aristotle extols are the balance between two vices.
Bravery might be the balance between cowardice and brashness. Virtue Ethics

of a public one, but was very involved in the public sphere. He claimed that we
should live virtuously, and yet was often the center of scandal in Rome. Seneca
was also a playwright. There is more debate as to whether these plays supported

Locke famously claimed that the mind is a blank slate, or a tabula rasa when we
are born. Only through experience can we write about it, or learn more.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"DM Serif Display"'>Locke also made a distinction between primary
and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are those that exist without people,
such as shape, number or motion. Secondary qualities are those that require
some human input like color or sound. According to Locke, without a person to
give a vibration in the air or an electromagnetic wave meaning, you do not have
sound or a color. These qualities are not in the objects themselves, they are
made by our mind’s interaction with the objects. If a tree falls in the middle of
the woods, it does not make a sound. </span></p>

Rousseau was born in 1712 in Geneva. His mother died in childbirth and his
father, a watchmaker, gave him up when he was exiled from the city. He
eventually came under the care of a noblewoman, Madame de Warens. This
relationship afforded him the opportunity to meet diderot and eventually
contributed to his encyclopedia. After winning a prize in an essay writing
competition, Rousseau published his first book around age forty, but was
instantly successful. He continued to write until his opinions forced him to
flee to England at the invitation of David Hume. He struggled there with mental
illness and became convinced that Hume was plotting against him. He returned to
France and completed many works but eventually is suspected to have committed

by saying: “Man is born free, and he is everywhere in chains.” This theme of
attempting to find a balance between individual rights dn the authority of the
state pervaded much of his work. Rousseau feared that the masses would leave
themselves subject to an elite ruling minority for fear of falling into a state
of war. According to Rousseau, we must avoid this by taking our laws and
dictums from “the general will” or the opinions that are agreed on by all
citizens. Since these citizens are only subject to something they agree to,
they are able to conform to the authority of the state without sacrificing
their own personal freedom. The problem with this approach was that his
specific definition of “the general will” was inexact. Was this the will of the
majority of the society and therefore should inspire the subjugation of the
minority by the majority. Was it instead the abstract path that would lead to
the good of society (regardless of the opinions of individual citizens)? The
application of how to deal with individuals whose will disagreed with the will
of the society or refused to comply was somewhat dark. According to Rousseau
“This means nothing less than that he will be forced to be free” Many take this
almost totalitarian interpretation to have been one of the inspirations for
Robespierre’s Reign of Terror.</span></p>

to attempt to manipulate or mold the mind of the children directly, but rather
to design the children’s environment in such a way as to allow the children to
discover things for themselves. Students should learn through practical
experience for Rousseau, and they should be punished with the natural

nothing, and the critical period where he wrote his major works (Critique of

through sense experience, the sky is blue. The other distinction is between
synthetic propositions and analytic propositions. Analytic propositions are

font-family:"DM Serif Display"'>Kant is credited with resolving the debate
between empiricists and the rationalists. In order to understand Kant’s
signature achievement, we need to first remember an argument offered by David
Hume who, by Kant’s own words, woke him from his “dogmatic slumber”. Hume
argued that we cannot have knowledge of such things as causality, since our
understanding of them cannot be a priori (I cannot know what a fire will do to
a paper without experience) but it cannot be a posteriori (I cannot only
through experience know that the paper will always burn). According to Kant, Hume’s
mistake was that he assumed that the only kind of a priori knowledge was of
analytic propositions. Kant will claim that we can have a priori, synthetic
knowledge. According to Kant such statements as 2+3=5 are synthetic (nothing
about the meaning of 2 and 3 means the same thing as 5), and yet we do not need
experience to learn that 2+3=5. Kant will leverage this notino to attempt to
resolve the disagreement between the rationalists and the empiricists. Kant
claimed that we are born with synthetic, a priori concepts, like number, time
and space which we apply to experience. Unlike Hume, when faced with the
possibility that we cannot gain these ideas through experience and that we
could not have knowledge without them, Kant claims that we must have had them
all along. Kant did not reject the skepticism of Hume entirely though.
According to Kant we can only have knowledge about the world of experiences, or
the phenomenological world, not the world as it actually is, or the
noumenological world.</span></p>

font-family:"DM Serif Display"'>Kant’s work in ethics was also important and
revolutionary. He wanted to find a justification for action that was not based
in religion. He was searching for a “categorical imperative”. This would be
some rule that was not just good for doing something (like a shovel is good for
digging holes) but good itself (if an object does the task it is good for the
job (idunno im not astrophysics)). Kant wanted this rule to be based on reason
itself. Kant arrived at the idea of claiming that an action is good if we can universalize
it into a rule without it becoming self-defeating. You should not steal because
if everyone stole the idea of property would fall apart. You should not kill
because if everyone killed then the very idea of living life would fall apart.
If it cannot be generalized it is bad (you cannot eat candy once a week because
if everyone ate candy once a week nothing bad would happen). If it can be, it
is good. For example, everyone should keep promises, if we all did this, the
institution of promises would not fall apart.  </span></p>

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel attempted to expand on many of the ideas of Kant.
Due to the density of his works (and the fact that he used many words he
invented himself) there is a certain degree of controversy over what exactly is
meant by many of Hegel’s claims. But despite this difficulty, Hegel managed to
be a pioneer in logic and the philosophy of history.  Though much of his
logical work has been passed over, his historical and political work greatly
influenced Marx and remains interesting to this day. </span></p>

relatively well off family. His mother died when he was young from a fever.
When in seminary school he became friends with two significant figures in their
own rights, Friedrich Holderlin, a poet and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling,
soon to be a significant philosopher. After spending some time tutoring, Hegel
came to Jena at the invitation of Schelling where he taught until Napoleon came
through. He eventually taught at the University of Heidelberg and later served
as the chair and later rector of the University of Berlin. He left Berlin due
to his weak health during a cholera outbreak, but returned before the disease

to resolve this problem through what he would call a dialectic logic, but can

we begin with a thesis, or idea. That thesis continues until it reaches
something which contradicts it, an antithesis. Faced with this contradiction,
we create a synthesis, which accounts for both thesis and antithesis. This
synthesis becomes our new thesis (sum fake function cringey shit I decided to

distinction that Hegel attempted to synthesize was the idea of human freedom as
either completely rational libertarian freedom, or a deterministic battle
between reason and the passions. He did so by arguing for a certain type of compatibilism
involving choosing to lead an ethical life and participate in social
institutions, like family or government which were the real objects of freedom.

sent to study with Bentham and other liberals. He struggled with depression at
this point in his life as he realized that inventing a just society, the life
goal laid out for him by his family, would not bring him happiness. He worked for
much of his life for the East India Company and defended British Colonial Rule
in India claiming the people there were not civilized, but barbarous and needed
to be ruled. After marriage, he became even more of an outspoken advocate for
women’s rights. When he became an MP he was the first advocate of women’s

font-family:"DM Serif Display"'>Born in 1872 in a family of liberal, atheist,
British, aristocrats, Russell lost much of his close family in his first few
years of life. At the age of one he lost his godfather, J.S.M., at two he lost
his mother and sister, at four he lost his father and at six he lost his grandfather,
the former british prime minister. This left him to be raised by his very
religious Presbyterian grandmother. He contemplated suicide, and only did not
follow through because of a desire to learn more mathematics. At age 18, he had
denounced religion and become an atheist due in part to reading the works of
his godfather. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge where he met young G.E.
Moore and an older A.N. Whitehead. While there, he married Alys Pearsal Smith
(who he would later divorce) and wrote some of his most influential works
including “On Denoting” and “Principia Mathematica” (whose text was so long the
manuscript was carried in a wheelbarrow to the printer). As a lecturer at the
University of Cambridge he met a young Wittgenstein who he thought of as a
protege that would carry on his work in logic. His pacifist activities during
the first world war resulted in his dismissal from academia. He was even
imprisoned for arguing against US involvement in the war (though he enjoyed it
as it gave him time to read and write without interruption). After the war he
traveled around the world to Russia, China, Japan, and America, married and
eventually divorced Dora Black, and later married Patricia Spence. Though at
the beginning of the second world war he once again advocated for pacifism, he
eventually changed his tune with the rise of Hitler. During this time he was
appointed as a professor at City College of New York, but later dismissed
because of his atheism and views on sex and marriage in his book “Marriage and
Morals” (which he claims is the text that won him the Nobel Prize in Literature
in 1950). Einstein himself defended Russell in an open letter, famously saying
“Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds”
Russell went on to write his bestselling book “A History of Western
Philosophy”, survive a plane crash, and another divorce, remarry again (this
time to Edith Finch), advocate against the USSR, for nuclear disarmament
(eventually landing himself in prison again) and against the Vietnam war.
Russell died of influenza in 1970 not long after publishing a three volume
autobiography.</span></p>

font-family:"DM Serif Display"'>In his first book, Tractatus, Wittgenstein
claims to solve all of the problems of philosophy through the philosophy of
language. This “turn” towards language represented a major shift in
philosophical thought. It is made through the claim that the most basic
elements of the world are not objects, but rather facts or states of affairs. 
Propositions and thoughts are pictures in one’s head. These pictures are made
true by corresponding to facts. The elements of a picture each correspond
isomorphically to the object in the fact or state of affairs. And the relations
in the proposition correspond to the way the state of affairs is arranged.
Wittgenstein also divides language into three categories, sense, lacking sense,
and nonsense. If a proposition does not have some fact or picture of the world
that it corresponds to, then it lacks sense or it is nonsense, this means that
the statements of logic, lack sense, and are only given truth values by
convention. Propositions about ethics, aesthetics and anything else which does
not have a clear fact in the world which it corresponds to are as meaningless
as “Russell is identical”.  This goes for mathematical claims like “five is a
number” and even metaphysical claims like “objects exist”. Basically
Wittgenstein said that it was nonsense to even try to talk about these things,
relegating much of philosophy to the garbage. Instead of these pursuits,
philosophers should engage in critiques of language and clarification of thoughts.
Philosophy should not be perceived as a doctrine so much as an activity to be
engaged in. Since much of the Tractatus is statements which are now declared to
be nonsense, Wittgenstein claims it is a ladder which we must use to see the
world, but after doing so we must get rid of that ladder, since we have learned
it is meaningless. There are many different conflicting interpretations of this
book, including Russell’s  interpretation which he wrote in the preface to the
book (but Wittgenstein disagreed with).</span></p>

second most famous book, was published posthumously along with much of his

philosophy as a therapy, instead of a critique. HE claimed that language was
actually a set of games that followed particular rules. Meanings of words are
dependent on their use, and the language games that they are being used in. In
other words, given different contexts a single word may have different uses and
therefore mean different things. Language games include things like telling a
joke, making up a story or making up and testing a hypothesis. What determines
the rules of these games and the use of these words is a common shared
experience. Grammar is not an external system of rules, but how we play the
language game. He preferred the concept of family resemblance between words
when offering definitions to the commonly uxdc necessary and sufficient
conditions. </span></p>
